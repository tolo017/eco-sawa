Slide 5 — Business model

Slide 6 — Market & traction

Closing
- Quick demo link reminder and call to action: "Try the demo at http://localhost:4000, or I can run it live."

Notes for demo
- Start server beforehand: cd backend && node simple-server.js.
- Use "Simulate pickups" on rescuer page to seed map and show flow.
- Use create listing on donor page to show QR token and then confirm on rescuer.
